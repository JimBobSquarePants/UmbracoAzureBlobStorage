Azure Blob Storage for Umbraco
==============================
This code was inspired by Johannes MÃ¼ller.

This is intended to replaces the Umbraco.Core.IO.PhysicalFileSystem for media files. 
All files will be stored in the configured Azure storage as blobs.

To run the tests in Visual Studio 2012 you need and extension like NuGet package "NUnit Test Adapter" in your Visual Studio toolbox.
